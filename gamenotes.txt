Rules to live by:
- The player is _always_ in control of something in some way
	- No waiting, ever, at any point. Even loading screens must be interactive
	- No popups, no stops no gaps
	- This guarantees constant action
- None or minimal sprite-work
	- everything should be drawn with shapes & pixels
- Show don't tell
	- Minimal hints, if control hints are needed then they should be small and overlaid
- The player should feel like the god of their own little world.
	- Movement should be fluid and natural
- As much as possible within the game should be intractable
- Never mention the words: 'die', 'kill', 'win', 'lose', 'game', 'lives'
- Only make games you've never played before


# growth game
- particles stick to you
- when they stick to you they move with you as part of you
- if any part of you touches the edge, you lose
- particles spawn on the edge of the screen at a random position, and move in a random direction
	- possible range of angles should be towards the middle of the screen???
	  (this is to avoid particles spawning and despawning too quickly)
- particles despawn when they reach the other edge of the screen
- score based on number of particles stuck to you
	- (or maybe n of particles spawned or n or particles despawned)
- particles get faster/more spawned per second as the game goes on


### must-have features:
- simple button click to restart
- score (number of spawned particles)
- colours:
	- particles come in different colours
	- options:
		- particles are created with a colour and that colour increases by 1 across the rainbow
		- particles are colourless when they are created but start changing colours when they stick to you,
		  always different colours based on when they touch you (there is some internal counter)
	- Colours should modulo within a range (eg each (r, g, b) for 50 <= r, g, b < 170)
- possible sound design styles:
	- classic bleep bloop
	- something muted
- simple, minimalist menu:
	- colours get muted when you lose
	- black and white, bold text, in a pixelated / classic 'code' style
- FIGURE OUT COOLER WORD THAN 'GAME OVER', something that sounds scientific (maybe 'SATURATION REACHED/EXCEEDED')


### maybe?:
- adjust acceleration
- different types of particles that have different movement patterns/ cause different effects?
	- different shape: (careful to not be too tetris-like)
	- different sizes: (different sizes worth different amount of points?)
	- different patterns would be different colours/have different coloured outlines
	- possible types:
		- slow/fast
		- wobbly
		- curved (angle of curvature constant per colour?
		- make you move faster/slower
		- delete particles off you??? (difficult as would have to deal with bits falling off you - intensive)
- sounds change as game goes on
	- each particle makes a small quiet noise at a particular pitch - as you grow, more and more sounds (very loud when near max)
